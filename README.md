# Test

This is the solution for the Senior QA Automation Assessment

In the **part_one** folder you can find the solution for the part 1 of the assessment
and also find the readme file to execute the code and its tests

The **part_two** folder contains the framework for the part 2 of the assessment, and there is the read me file as well 

Once everything is configured you can run the following command to run the part 1 and 2
```
bash run.sh 
```
